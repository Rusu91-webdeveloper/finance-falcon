# 📂 Finance Falcon - Server

Welcome to the **Finance Falcon** backend! This folder contains the server-side code for the Finance Falcon app, built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). The server handles the API requests, user authentication, and data management.

## 📝 Overview

This is the backend part of the Finance Falcon application. It serves as the API layer for the frontend, managing database operations, authentication, and other server-side logic.

## 🛠️ Setup Instructions

### 1. Install Dependencies

First, ensure you have all the required dependencies installed. From the `server` directory, run:

```bash
npm install
```
### 2. Environment Variables

To run the frontend on your own setup, you'll need to configure environment variables. We've provided an `.env.example` file in the `server` directory that outlines the necessary variables.

1. **Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env`:**

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
### 3.Run the server

   ```bash
   node.index.js
   ```
